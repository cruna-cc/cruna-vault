# Cruna Vault: The Future of Secure Digital Asset Management

Welcome to Cruna Vault, a groundbreaking innovation in the world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Unlike ordinary NFTs, Cruna Vault is a powerful tool designed to enhance the safety and management of your digital assets, perfect for pairing with [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) smart wallets.

## Cruna Vault + ERC-6551: A Game-Changer in Asset Security

ERC-6551 defines a system which assigns EVM-compatible accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.

While the ERC-6551 standard is a significant step forward in the evolution of NFTs, it lacks a critical component: security. The standard does not specify any security requirements for the NFT to whom the account is bound. This omission leaves the NFT vulnerable to unauthorized access and misuse, undermining the security of the entire system.

Cruna Vault is specially designed to work with ERC-6551 wallets, a new way for NFTs to manage digital assets seamlessly.

### Meet the Protectors

Protectors are like personal guardians for your NFT. As an NFT owner, you can appoint one or more Protectors who must approve any transfer or change. This dual-level security means even if your account is compromised, your NFT stays safe. For added convenience in specific scenarios, like in a company setting, you can set up special rules where certain transfers don't need Protector approval.

Once you set up your first Protector, adding or removing others requires approval too, ensuring no single person can make unilateral changes. This setup is ideal for those who value robust security in managing their digital assets.

_It is advisable to assign multiple Protectors to maintain access to the vault even if one Protector becomes inaccessible. Reasonably, if there is a need for more than two Protectors, it may make sense to transfer the ownership of the vault to a multisig wallet._

### Sentinels and Asset Recovery

Imagine a system that safeguards your assets even if you lose access or in case of unforeseen life events. That's what Sentinels do in Cruna Vault. They work on a Proof-of-Life system â€“ you periodically signal that you're still in control. If you can't, Sentinels can start a process to pass your assets to a chosen Beneficiary.

This feature is not just about security; it's about peace of mind and ensuring your digital legacy is preserved and passed on as intended.

## Real-World Applications with ERC-6551

* **Asset Consolidation**: Easily transfer a collection of assets in one go.
